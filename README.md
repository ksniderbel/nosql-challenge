# nosql-challenge

This homework was completed as part of a team effort between Carmen Wiggens, Haritha Koleti, Michelle Petras, and Kathleen Sndier-Belinski (me), with some assistance from TA Sheri Rosalia.  Google was also our friend.

For this project, we will analyze restaurants in the United Kingdom.  Data was imported using mongoimport tool from a file called establishments.json.  We were able to update the database and remove other records (from Dover).  Once the data was where it needed to be, our analysis based on hygiene scores and geographic location were able to be processed.

Two resulting files were created:
NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb that put the data in the database.
NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynballowed us to create an interactive web page with the data points we wanted.
